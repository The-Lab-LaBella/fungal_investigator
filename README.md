# Fungal Investigator

Greetings Doctor! Thank you for coming to help us diagnose these patients. 

We know you are a **world-renowned fungal geneticist**, and we greatly appreciate your help. 

As you know, fungal infections are serious and impact many people and animals around the world.

# Choose a patient

Below are the patients that our clinic has seen with fungal infections. 

We have cultured the fungi from the patients and sequenced a specific region of their DNA called the ITS.

# Identify the fungus

Identifying fungi in patients can be done by looking at the cells. It is important, however, that we know exactly which species each patient is infected with. That can provide valuable information about how to treat the infection.
