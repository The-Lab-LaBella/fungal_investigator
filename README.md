# Fungal Investigator

Greetings Doctor! Thank you for coming to help us diagnose these patients. 

We know you are a **world-renowned fungal geneticist**, and we greatly appreciate your help. 

As you know, fungal infections are serious and impact many people and animals around the world. 

With your help, we can **diagnose the infections** at our clinic.

# Choose a patient

Below are the patients that our clinic has seen with fungal infections. 

We have cultured the fungi from the patients and sequenced a specific region of their DNA called the ITS. 

Please report all of your findings here: _INCLUDE LINK_

# Identify the fungus

Identifying fungi in patients can be done by looking at the cells. It is important, however, that we know exactly which species each patient is infected with. That can provide valuable information about how to treat the infection. To identify our fungal species, we will use DNA Sequencing.

## DNA - the genetic instructions

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms.

## DNA differs between individuals and species

You and your cousins or siblings have similar DNA sequences
