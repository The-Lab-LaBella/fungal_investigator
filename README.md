# Welcome! Fungal Investigator

Greetings Doctor! Thank you for coming to help us diagnose these patients. 

We know you are a **world-renowned fungal geneticist**, and we greatly appreciate your help. 

As you know, fungal infections are serious and impact many people and animals around the world. 

Many types of fungi, like the mushrooms you get on pizza, are harmless. However, some fungi are microscopic and can infect people! 

With your help, we can **diagnose the infections** at our clinic.

# Step 1 - Choose a patient

Below are the patients that our clinic has seen with fungal infections. 

We have cultured the fungi from the patients and sequenced a specific region of their DNA called the ITS. 

Please report all of your findings here: _INCLUDE LINK_

# Step 2 - How to identify a microscopic fungus

Identifying fungi in patients can be done by looking at the cells. It is important, however, that we know exactly which species each patient is infected with. That can provide valuable information about how to treat the infection. To identify our fungal species, we will use DNA Sequencing.

## DNA - the genetic instructions

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms.

## DNA differs between individuals and species

You and your siblings and/or cousins have similar DNA because you share ancestors (parents or grandparents).

Similarly, species share similar DNA because they are descended from a common ancestor.

## DNA Barcoding 

Fungal species differ from each other in ways we can use to identify them. 

This is called a **DNA Barcode** - this is a region of DNA that can be matched to a reference database for species identification. 

If we visualize DNA such that each base in the sequence is a different color - we can see the differences between the barcodes.

# Step 3 - Analyze your patient's fungal sequence

The clinic has sequenced the barcode region of the fungus infecting your patient. 

This sequence will help you identify what species of fungus is causing the illness. 

## Examine your sequence

The DNA sequences for the barcode region are here:
- alex_c
- casey_m
- pepper_a
- blake_c
- nellie_c

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Copy the sequence into the NCBI BLAST search 

Open this link - https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome 

Paste your DNA Sequence into the box labeled **Enter Query Sequence** and hit the **BLAST** button

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


## Examine the results and report the species infecting your patient

What fungus is causing your patient to get sick?
